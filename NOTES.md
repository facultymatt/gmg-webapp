# Todo

- improve style on lines and make them easy to read
- improve refresh time with data reduction over the wire

- prevent accidental grill commands to command urls
- better way to see start and stop range on single graph from cook. Does not need to be realtime. Could refresh every 10 seconds, for ex. 
- better utilize height of page to make it easier to see differences in scale - probe temp is always 200 ish or less while grill sometimes gets set at 500 - makes it hard to see the details in probe temp

- UI to visualize all the status bits - pizza mode, current debug dump
- UI with buttons to turn on / off the command API features

- Use temperature of grill before cook to measure ambient temp outside. (trey feedback)
- Can we get better temperate data in realtime or over time?
